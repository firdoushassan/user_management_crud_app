# User Management CRUD App

## Overview
This is a basic implementation of a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application built with Java Spring Boot for the backend, React for the frontend, 
and MySQL for the database mainly focusing on :
Spring Security
JWT (JSON Web Tokens) Authentication
Validation
CRUD Operations
Developed for my internship at Main Flow Services and Technologies pvt. ltd.


## Features
- CRUD Operations: Basic Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for managing users.
- Spring Security: Implementation of security features like user authentication and authorization.
- JWT Authentication: Secure API access using JSON Web Tokens (JWT).
- Validation: Input validation is applied to ensure data integrity.
  
## Technologies Used
- Spring Boot
- Spring Security
- JWT

- PUT /api/users/{id}: Update a specific user.
- DELETE /api/users/{id}: Delete a specific user.
- POST /api/login: Login and receive a JWT token.
